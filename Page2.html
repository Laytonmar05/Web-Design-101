                Web design first started in the late 1980's, but it was a lot different then it was today. This was around the start of the world wide web, where each webpage was simply a text document on the screen. There were no images or sound. Later in the 90's, modern day CSS, Javascript and HTML were born. At the start of the 21st century web deisng became a lot more similar to what we know today, supporting basically everything a "normal" webpage would have.</p>
